dotfiles
===================

(Here's what my setup looks like. Vim/Tmux)

## New to Vim?
+ [Learning Vim in a Week](https://mikecoutermarsh.com/boston-vim-learning-vim-in-a-week/)
+ [Upcase: The Art of Vim](https://upcase.com/vim) 

If you're brand new to Vim, I recommend using [ThoughtBot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles). They are better maintained than mine :).  

## Installation

If you have trouble during installation, please open an issue or pull request. :star:

Clone this repo (or your own fork!) to your **home** directory (`/Users/username`).
```
git clone https://github.com/mscoutermarsh/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

### Recommended

**iterm2**
Use iterm2 instead of Terminal: http://iterm2.com/

$ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
```
